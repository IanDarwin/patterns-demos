= Builder

Builder pattern moves the creational interface from traditional constructors
to a new Builder class. The benefit is that, instead of a single method with
a zillion arguments, many of which may be of the same type (int and String
are common), you have a Builder object with setter-like methods to install
the various fields into the builder before the call to build().

The build() method also provides a choke point for cross-field validation.

The Builder may be a top-level class distinct from the built class, in which
case the constructor must remain public (or at least package visible); this
is how IntelliJ's `Replace Constructor With Builder` refactoring does things
when it gets to create the builder. Alternately, as shown here, the Builder
can be an inner class of the built class, in which case the Builder methods
are public and the constructor(s) become private; IRL you only need the
constructor that accepts the Builder as an argument.
